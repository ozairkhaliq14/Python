Iterative deepening depth first search

I used python 3.11.2 64-bit on windows for this assignment. 
Mainly VS Code and then gradescope for autograder.

Used ChatGPT to debug and improve code.

Some of the prompts I typed in were:

The only thing I used ChatGPT for this assignment was to figure out how the "frontier" element works, since professor used it in the hw3 solution
Also ChatGPT gave a suggestion for a get_all_nodes_at_depth function to help calculate memory used at every node.
This didn't really come out very accurate compared to the frontier method that I used, so the output for this is currently commented out.
But it is a good idea for any future assignments, It is good to know how it works.

Whenever I got any erros on gradescope I would just copy paste that part of the code and say "autograder gives error "..." for this part of the code".
And then ChatGPT would explain what the reason for the error is and give the corrected code.
